***** "awesome" README File *****

This directory contains all the necessary Awesome window manager (WM) configuration files, including panel icons and widgets. 

-- Note: Tried and tested with Arch Linux, Kernel Version 3.13.5-1. If any problems arise make sure to check that you have all modules installed on your machine (necessary modules can be found in "rc.lua"). These files should be placed under the 
    "~/.config/awesome/" 
directory. The one directory that contains information that is not needed under "~/.config/awesome" is the "themes" directory. The "theme.lua" file should be placed in
    "/usr/share/awesome/themes/THEME_NAME/"
and the taglist icons should be placed in that same directory. In the "theme.lua" file and in other .lua config files, I specify "Inconsolata" as the font. This font can either be changed in ALL files or can simply be downloaded with 
    "sudo pacman -S ttf-inconsolata"
and from then on it will be recognized.
